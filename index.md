This lesson provides an introduction into Continuous Integration (CI)
and Continuous Delivery / Deployment (CD)
using [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

After learning how to [test code](https://intersect-training.org/testing-lesson/)
and [packaging](https://intersect-training.org/packaging/) for distribution,
one would like to automate these tasks as much as possible.

This is where CI and CD tools come in: automating code integrations and deployments continously!
